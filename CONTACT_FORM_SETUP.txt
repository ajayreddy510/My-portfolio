CONTACT FORM – RECEIVE MESSAGES TO YOUR EMAIL
==============================================

Right now the form does not send emails because it needs your Formspree form ID.

Steps (free, takes ~2 minutes):
--------------------------------
1. Go to: https://formspree.io
2. Sign up (or log in) with your email.
3. Click "New Form".
4. Give it a name (e.g. "Portfolio contact") and use your email: reddyajay510@gmail.com
5. After creating the form, you'll see a form endpoint like:
   https://formspree.io/f/xyzabcde
   The part after /f/ is your FORM ID (e.g. xyzabcde).
6. Open index.html in your portfolio folder.
7. Find this line:
   action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID"
8. Replace YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID with your actual form ID, e.g.:
   action="https://formspree.io/f/xyzabcde"
9. Save index.html. From then on, when someone submits the form, you'll get the message at reddyajay510@gmail.com.

Formspree free tier: 50 submissions per month (enough for a portfolio).
